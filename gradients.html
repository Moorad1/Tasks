  <h1>Gradients</h1>
  <p>Gradients are a range of colours that shift from a certain colour (like blue) to a different colour (like purple) smoothly. There are a range of pre-built colour gradients in Tasks but Tasks also gives you the ability to make your own gradients to customise your Tasks Todo List environment. Firstly, Tasks uses Hex Code Colours to represent colours. There are a wide varity of ways a computer can read colours (This is Hex Colours, RGB Colours, HSL Colours, HWB Colours, CMYK Colours and the Natural Color System). Hex is a 16 base colour system which can be read like that #RRGGBB. First two slots are for representing red colours, The 3rd and 4th slots for Green and the last two are for Blue. The # is not needed.

  <h1>UI Gradients</h1>
  <p>Here is a website called <a href="https://uigradients.com/" target="_blank">UIGradients</a> which has a lot of amazing gradients. Look around UI Gradients and when you find the perfect gradient for you (It has to have only 2 value to get the same gradient) just copy the first code and put it in the first box in the custom gradient section (You can go into the custom gradient section by going to Settings > Customisation and then you will find it) and then copy the second colour and paste it in the second box then press Set. Then everything will work.</p>
